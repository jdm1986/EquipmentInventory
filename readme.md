The project I chose to create is one that solves a common problem at my company: which machines are available for rent, and which machines are on rent or otherwise unavailable. If a salesperson if away from the equipment yard, it would be helpful to be able to quickly analyze the availability situation.

I am styling the page to resemble our current company website in some aspects, but am diverging from that style as I see fit. Essentially, when complete, the project will access a database of owned equipment. Each piece of equipment will be designated as available or unavailable. The user interface will mark these differences clearly. I am not sure if I will list unavailable equipment at all, but it would be nice to list that equipment with details (ex: "Expected back on October 31, 2018" or "In shop until first week of June, 2018").
